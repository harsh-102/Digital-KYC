# Digital-KYC
This project includes a secure and intelligent digital KYC (Know Your Customer) system that leverages Al-powered document analysis and facial recognition to verify user identities
A Secure, Automated Solution for Document Verification and Facial Recognition

# Overview

This project implements an AI-powered Digital KYC (Know Your Customer) and Identity Verification System that:
 Detects forged/tampered documents (Aadhaar, Passport, PAN, Driverâ€™s License)
 Performs facial recognition to match ID photos with live selfies
 Ensures GDPR & DPDP Act compliance with secure data handling
 Provides a modular, scalable API for integration into banking, fintech, and eKYC platforms

Built with Python, OpenCV, Dlib, and Deep Learning models for high accuracy.
